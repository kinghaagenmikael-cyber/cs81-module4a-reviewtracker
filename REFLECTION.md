Reflection

## What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?
The most helpful part of the code was how the reading data was stored as an array of objects. This made it easy to loop through the data and access specific properties like the book title or minutes read. Separating tasks into functions also made the code easier to understand and reuse.

## What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
Understanding how the object used for counting book frequency worked took the most time. Once I realized that the object keys represented book titles and the values tracked counts, the logic became clearer.
